Backbone SOS
============

Sometimes you need to know whether a model/collection is interacting with the
server or not. Backbone SOS (State Of Sync) can help you track this in a very
decoupled way, by keeping the loading state where it belongs (inside your
model/collection).

One clear use case is that now you can write views that "react" accondingly to
the loading state of your data, and make your app feel snappier.
